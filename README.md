# Hotel Manager

Hotel Manager is a web application designed to efficiently manage hotel operations. The application allows users to view available rooms, make reservations, add additional services, review bills, and leave feedback. Hotel administrators have access to a management dashboard where they can review all reservations, add or remove rooms, and manage prices and discounts. The application also automatically generates invoices for each reservation.
